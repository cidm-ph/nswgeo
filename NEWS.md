# nswgeo (development version)

* Add Primary Health Network (PHN) map data as `phn` dataset.
* Fixed the `poa_nsw` dataset to avoid strange geometries near the state border.
* Added geometries for Lord Howe Island, Australian Capital Territory, and
  Jervis Bay Territory, and a utility function `outline()` for using them.
* Slightly increase the resolution to 750 m instead of 1 km.

# nswgeo 0.3.3

* Initial CRAN release.
